# CINEMA SERVICE APPLICATION

This project is a blueprint for future development and deploying as Cinema Service application. 
Was used Java Spring Framework for using MVC pattern, JavaBeans representation of data models and their lifecycles and relations into IoC container of Application and Security app context, also using JBDC driver interface and Hibernate ORM tools for data manipulation.

Program code and description of users for registration can be found in the DataInitializer class.

Applyed next principles during the development of the program:
- MVC pattern
- REST API
- SOLID principles

Project based on 3-layer architecture:
- Presentation layer (CONTROLLERS)
- Application layer (SERVICES)
- Data access layer (DAO)

# Features
- Register a new user
- Role-based authorization (admin, user) 
- Exception handling (invalid username, password, invalid role) with appropriate messages
- Access registered user to relevant functional endpoints deployed by Cinema Service application

# Details of functionality with using REST API
- POST: /register (to create a user) - ALL
- POST: /cinema-halls (to create a cinema hall) - ADMIN
- POST: /movies (to create a movie) - ADMIN
- POST: /movie-sessions (to create a movie session) - ADMIN
- POST: /orders/complete (to create an order for current user) - USER
- PUT: /movie-sessions/{id} (to update a movie session) - ADMIN
- PUT: /shopping-carts/movie-sessions (to add movie session to shopping cart) - USER
- DELETE: /movie-sessions/{id} (to delete a movie session) - ADMIN
- GET: /orders (to get order history for current user) - USER
- GET: /shopping-carts/by-user (to get a shopping cart for current user) - USER
- GET: /cinema-halls (to get all cinema halls) - USER or ADMIN
- GET: /movies (to get all movies) - USER or ADMIN
- GET: /movie-sessions/available (to get all available movie by date) - USER or ADMIN
- GET: /users/by-email (to find user by email) - ADMIN

All endpoints used JSON transfer data format (except for the login page, which is generated by Spring security component). All endpoints created by Cinema Service application are secured by role-based authorization.
